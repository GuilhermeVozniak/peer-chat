# Peer Chat

üöÄ A modern WebRTC learning project - Build real-time peer-to-peer communication from scratch using cutting-edge web technologies.

## Overview

Dive deep into the world of real-time web communication! This hands-on project explores WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology, teaching you to build lightning-fast peer-to-peer applications. Create seamless text chat, crystal-clear audio/video calls, and powerful screen sharing - all running directly between browsers with zero external media servers.

**Learning Focus**: Understanding WebRTC fundamentals, signaling protocols, peer-to-peer networking, and real-time communication patterns.

> üé• **Inspired by**: [WebRTC Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsH8FL0952k) - Following modern WebRTC implementation patterns and best practices.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (React 19)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky
- **WebRTC**: Native browser APIs
- **Signaling**: WebSocket (to be implemented)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
