# Peer Chat

A WebRTC learning project for implementing real-time peer-to-peer communication in web browsers.

## Overview

This project is a hands-on learning implementation of WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology. It demonstrates how to build real-time communication features like text chat, audio/video calling, and screen sharing directly between web browsers without requiring external servers for media relay.

**Learning Focus**: Understanding WebRTC fundamentals, signaling protocols, peer-to-peer networking, and real-time communication patterns.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (React 19)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky
- **WebRTC**: Native browser APIs
- **Signaling**: WebSocket (to be implemented)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeVozniak/peer-chat.git
cd peer-chat

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Available Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm start        # Start production server

# Code Quality
pnpm lint         # Check code issues
pnpm lint:fix     # Auto-fix issues
pnpm format       # Format code
pnpm type-check   # TypeScript validation
pnpm code-quality # Run all quality checks
```
