# WebRTC Learning Guide

This document outlines the WebRTC concepts and learning objectives for the peer-chat project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Inspiration

This project is inspired by practical WebRTC implementations and follows modern best practices for building real-time communication applications. The implementation approach is based on comprehensive WebRTC tutorials that demonstrate production-ready patterns.

**Primary Reference**: [WebRTC Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsH8FL0952k) - A comprehensive guide to implementing WebRTC from scratch.

## What is WebRTC?

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables real-time, peer-to-peer communication between web browsers without requiring plugins or external applications.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Audio, video, and data transmission
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Direct communication between browsers
- **No Plugins Required**: Built into modern browsers
- **Secure**: Encrypted by default
- **Cross-platform**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Core WebRTC Concepts

### 1. PeerConnection

The main API for establishing peer-to-peer connections:

```javascript
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration);
```

### 2. Signaling

The process of coordinating communication between peers:
- Exchange connection information
- Negotiate media capabilities
- Handle network traversal

### 3. ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)

Network traversal technique to establish connections through NATs and firewalls:
- **STUN servers**: Discover public IP address
- **TURN servers**: Relay traffic when direct connection fails

### 4. SDP (Session Description Protocol)

Format for describing multimedia sessions:
- Media capabilities
- Network information
- Security parameters

## Technical Deep Dives Completed

### 1. WebRTC Peer Connection Management

**Implementation**: `lib/webrtc.client.ts`

```typescript
export function createEnhancedPeerConnection(
  participantId: string,
  callbacks: PeerConnectionCallbacks,
): RTCPeerConnection {
  const configuration: RTCConfiguration = {
    iceServers: [
      { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
      // TURN servers can be added here
    ],
  };

  const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration);
  
  // Event handlers for connection lifecycle
  peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
    if (event.candidate) {
      callbacks.onIceCandidate(participantId, event.candidate);
    }
  };

  peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
    callbacks.onTrack(participantId, event.streams[0]);
  };

  return peerConnection;
}
```

### 2. Advanced Media Stream Management

**Implementation**: `lib/video.client.ts`

```typescript
export const getVideoStream = async (
  constraints?: StreamConstraints,
): Promise<MediaStream | undefined> => {
  try {
    const videoConstraints = constraints?.videoDeviceId
      ? { deviceId: { exact: constraints.videoDeviceId } }
      : true;

    const audioConstraints = constraints?.audioDeviceId
      ? { deviceId: { exact: constraints.audioDeviceId } }
      : (constraints?.audio ?? false);

    return await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
      video: constraints?.video !== false ? videoConstraints : false,
      audio: audioConstraints,
    });
  } catch (e) {
    handleError(e as Error);
  }
};
```

### 3. Audio Feedback Prevention

**Key Innovation**: Separate local and remote audio handling

```typescript
// Local video: Always muted (prevent feedback)
// Remote videos: Only muted if their audio is disabled
muted={isLocal || !isAudioEnabled || !hasActiveAudioTrack}
```

This ensures users don't hear their own voice while still transmitting audio to others.

### 4. Real-time Device Management

**Implementation**: Dynamic device switching without reconnection

```typescript
const switchVideoDevice = useCallback(async (deviceId: string) => {
  setSelectedVideoDevice(deviceId);
  
  // Re-create stream with new device
  await initializeLocalStream();
  
  // Update all peer connections with new tracks
  peerConnectionsRef.current.forEach((peerConnection) => {
    const senders = peerConnection.getSenders();
    stream.getTracks().forEach((track) => {
      const sender = senders.find((s) => s.track?.kind === track.kind);
      if (sender) {
        sender.replaceTrack(track).catch(console.error);
      }
    });
  });
}, [setSelectedVideoDevice, initializeLocalStream]);
```

### 5. Signaling Protocol Design

**WebSocket Message Types**:
- `join-room`: Participant joining with optional name and creator flag
- `leave-room`: Participant leaving (triggers room cleanup if creator)
- `webrtc-offer/answer/ice-candidate`: Standard WebRTC signaling
- `room-terminated`: Broadcast when room creator leaves
- `participant-joined/left`: Real-time participant updates

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Efficient Peer Connection Management
- Reuse connections when possible
- Proper cleanup on participant leave
- Track replacement instead of connection recreation

### 2. Media Stream Optimization
- Stop unused tracks to free resources
- Lazy loading of device lists
